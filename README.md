Lily58 QMK Configuration files that include volume encoder, RGB, DEL and IJKL as arrow keys

A simple repository for this keyboard.  Took me a while to figure out and had to come to different sources to compile the code.  It isn't ground breaking but I couldn't find an updated version of these configuration files that included the encoder, rgb and a delete button to log into windows.
